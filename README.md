## Project Overview 
The **IPL Win Predictor** uses historical IPL match data(2008-2019) to train a machine learning model, which is then deployed using **Streamlit** to create an interactive web app. Users can input match details such as teams, city, score, wickets and overs, and the app will output the predicted win probability for each team.
